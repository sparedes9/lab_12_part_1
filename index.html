<h1>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h1> <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Say it in Russian! Your best is an idiot!</p> <h2>Where the Buggalo Roam</h2> <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. You lived before you met me?! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p> <ul> <li>Your best is an idiot!</li> <li>But existing is basically all I do!</li> <li>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</li> <li>Hey, whatcha watching?</li> </ul> <h3>War Is the H-Word</h3> <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p> <h4>Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings</h4> <p>Say it in Russian! Why would a robot need to drink? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p> <ol> <li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li> <li>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</li> <li>Hey, whatcha watching?</li> </ol> <h5>A Head in the Polls</h5> <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Leela's gonna kill me. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p>
